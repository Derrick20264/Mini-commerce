# Mini E-Commerce - Single Page Application

This project is a lightweight e-commerce single-page application (SPA) developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates a basic online shopping experience with dynamic product interactions powered by a local JSON server.

The application was built as part of a software engineering course to demonstrate understanding of frontend development concepts including DOM manipulation, asynchronous data fetching, and basic CRUD operations using a mock API.

## Features

- Display products fetched from a local JSON server
- Add new products using a form (product name, price, category, and image)
- Filter products by category
- Like individual products to increase their like count
- Add and remove products from a client-side shopping cart (does not affect the main product list)
